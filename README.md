<h3> Criação do Backend iFood para fins acadêmicos baseado em Java! <h3>


  
<h2> Overview <h2>
 
The project in question is a simulation of iFood, a very popular food delivery platform. 
The objective of this simulation is to develop a system that reproduces some basic features of iFood, such as customer registration, restaurant management, placing orders, among others.

Through this simulation, users will be able to experience a simplified version of iFood, interacting with the services available in the application. 
The project seeks to provide an overview of the main features and workflows involved in operating a food delivery application.

It is important to note that this simulation is strictly for academic purposes, in order to learn and apply concepts of programming, software development and business logic. 
It has no relationship with the real iFood, nor is it intended to replace or compete with the service offered by the company.

Therefore, when using this project, it is important to understand that this is a simulation and does not represent the complete iFood experience.
